## Overview

Accordions are commonly used in web interfaces to organize content into collapsible sections. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the step-by-step process of building an accordion from scratch, focusing on both the visual design and the accessibility considerations.

## Key Features

- **Beautiful Styles**: We'll use SCSS to create a visually appealing design for the accordion, including custom colors, transitions, and animations.
- **Accessible Markup**: Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web development. We'll ensure the accordion is fully accessible to assistive technologies and follows best practices for keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **Flexible Configuration**: The accordion will be customizable, allowing you to easily modify the number of panels, default open/closed states, and other options to fit your specific needs.

## Usage

For a detailed walkthrough of the implementation process, refer to the blog post [How To Make A Beautiful Accessible Accordion With SCSS](https://thehelpfultipper.com/make-beautiful-accessible-accordion-scss/).
